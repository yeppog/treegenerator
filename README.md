# Tree Generator

This script generates a binary tree given preorder, inorder or postorder lists as inputs. It prints the tree out properly.

## Ways to use

### 1. Use the .exe file

The exe file is basically a compiled version of the python script. You do not need python to run the tree traversal generator. The exe was compiled using pyinstaller.

### 2. Run the python script directly

Run the python script directly from the terminal using python.
